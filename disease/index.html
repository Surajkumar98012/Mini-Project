      <div class="box" style="height:200px;">•  Over  65  million  people  in  the  United  States  have   a chronic,  incurable  sexually  transmitted  disease  (STD)? <br><br>
      •  And  that  every  year  another  19  million  persons  become  newly  infected  with  an  STD?<br><br>
      • Sexually transmitted diseases, or sexually transmitted infections (STIs), usually pass from one person to another through sexual contact. Most are fairly common, and effective treatment is available, especially in the early stages.<br><br></div>
      <p><b>Things To Know...</b></p>
      <p><b>Many people think there are only two  STDs - syphilis and gonorrhea. In fact,  there are many other diseases that can  be spread through sexual contact,  including herpes, chlamydia,  genital warts, vaginitis, viral  hepatitis and HIV (the virus that  causes AIDS).  
      Without treatment, these diseases can  lead to major health problems such as  sterility (not being able to get  pregnant), permanent brain damage,  heart disease, cancer, and even death.  If you think you have been exposed to a  sexually transmitted disease, you and your  sex partner(s) should visit a health clinic  or doctor for testing and treatment.</b></p>
      <p><b>You may have been exposed to an STD and should get tested if you have ever:</b></p>
      <p><b>• Had sex (vaginal, anal or oral) without using a condom with someone who has an STD or HIV, or whose status you do not know.<br><br>
      • Had sex without using a condom with someone who has ever injected drugs.<br><br>
      • Had many sex partners.</b></p>

      <h2><b><i>SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES</i></b></h2>
      <h5>About, May 1, 2020</h5>
      <p><b>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), also referred to as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), are infections that are commonly spread by sexual activity, especially vaginal intercourse, anal sex and oral sex. Many times STIs initially do not cause symptoms. This results in a greater risk of passing the disease on to others. Symptoms and signs of disease may include vaginal discharge, penile discharge, ulcers on or around the genitals, and pelvic pain. STIs can be transmitted to an infant before or during childbirth and may result in poor outcomes for the baby. Some STIs may cause problems with the ability to get pregnant.<br><br>

       More than 30 different bacteria, viruses, and parasites can be transmitted through sexual activity. Bacterial STIs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Viral STIs include genital herpes, HIV/AIDS, and genital warts. Parasitic STIs include trichomoniasis. While usually spread by sex, some STIs can be spread by non-sexual contact with donor tissue, blood, breastfeeding, or during childbirth. STI diagnostic tests are usually easily available in the developed world, but this is often not the case in the developing world.<br><br>

       The most effective way of preventing STIs is by not having sex. Some vaccinations may also decrease the risk of certain infections including hepatitis B and some types of HPV. Safer sex practices such as use of condoms, having a smaller number of sexual partners, and being in a relationship where each person only has sex with the other also decreases the risk. Circumcision in adult males may be effective to prevent some infections. During school, comprehensive sex education may also be useful. Most STIs are treatable or curable. Of the most common infections, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis are curable, while herpes, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, and HPV are treatable but not curable. Resistance to certain antibiotics is developing among some organisms such as gonorrhea.<br><br>

       In 2015, about 1.1 billion people had STIs other than HIV/AIDS. About 500 million were infected with either syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia or trichomoniasis. At least an additional 530 million people have genital herpes and 290 million women have human papillomavirus. STIs other than HIV resulted in 108,000 deaths in 2015. In the United States there were 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted infections in 2010. Historical documentation of STIs date back to at least the Ebers papyrus around 1550 BC and the Old Testament. There is often shame and stigma associated with these infections. The term sexually transmitted infection is generally preferred over sexually transmitted disease or venereal disease, as it includes those who do not have symptomatic disease.</b></p>

      <p><b>AIDS is the end result of infection with the virus HIV. HIV attacks the body’s defense system, making the body less able to fight off infections or cancers. People with HIV may have no symptoms, or may not even know that they have HIV. To cause infection, HIV must enter the bloodstream. This can happen during anal, vaginal and oral sex, or by sharing needles or works with a person who has HIV. HIV can also be passed from a mother who has HIV to her baby during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding.<br><br>
      Medicines given to a woman who has HIV during pregnancy and delivery, and to her baby at birth, can greatly lower the chances of her baby becoming infected with HIV. 
      There is no vaccine or cure for HIV. But there are medicines that can help infected people stay healthy longer. HIV testing is recommended as a routine part of a person's primary health care. If they find out they have the virus, they can start treatment early.

      <p><b>Gonorrhea is caused by bacteria spread from one infected person to another during sex. It can infect the urethra in a man’s penis, the cervix in a woman’s vagina, and the rectum and throat.<br><br>

      In men, the disease may cause burning during urination and discharge (drip) from the penis. Women often have no symptoms at all and may not know they are infected unless the disease is found during an examination. 
      Untreated gonorrhea can cause sterility in both women and men. In women, it can lead to Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) - an infection that causes severe lower abdominal pain and fever, and can result in sterility or miscarriage.<br><br>

      Infants born to women with gonorrhea can develop severe eye infections and meningitis.

    </div>
      <p><b>Syphilis is caused by bacteria that enter the body through the skin, the mouth, or the anus during sex. Within 10 to 90 days after infection, a sore may appear anywhere on the body including on or around the genitals, the rectum, or mouth. The sore is painless and it usually heals in two to three weeks even without treatment. Sometime after the sore appears, the organism enters the bloodstream and spreads throughout the body. This may be followed by a fever, headache, swollen glands, or rash especially on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet.<br><br>
      During its later stages, untreated syphilis can cause damage to the brain, heart, eyes, and other body parts. Although syphilis must be treated with antibiotics at this stage, no medicine can repair damage that syphilis has already done.<br><br>
      In a pregnant woman, untreated syphilis can cause birth defects and even death to her unborn baby. It is very important for pregnant women to have a blood test for syphilis as soon as they know they are pregnant.

      <p><b>Herpes is caused by a virus. It produces groups of blister-like sores on the genitals about two to 14 days after a person is exposed to the virus. Sometimes, a fever is present. The sores will break open and become painful, especially if they come in contact with urine. Even though the herpes sores may disappear, the virus is still present and the sores can return with little warning.<br><br>
        Most people infected with genital herpes have no symptoms and do not know they have the virus. Herpes can spread even when there are no sores or signs of the disease. In fact, most transmission of herpes happens in this way.<br><br>
        Cold sores are also a form of herpes. People with sores on the mouth or lips should not have oral sex because this may cause genital herpes in their sex partners. <br><br>
        A pregnant woman with genital herpes should tell her doctor. If precautions aren’t taken during childbirth, herpes can cause serious damage or even death to her baby.There is no known cure for herpes. But new drugs are helpful in treating the symptoms.</b></p>

However, up to 50% of men may have no symptoms or the symptoms are so mild, they may be ignored. In women, chlamydia causes an inflammation of the cervix (cervicitis).<br><br>
      Symptoms of this infection in women, when present, are mild and usually include a vaginal discharge or spotting (blood-tinged discharge), but the vast majority (approximately 75%) have no symptoms at all. Untreated chlamydia can cause Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) with pain, fever, miscarriage and infertility in women.<br><br>

    </div>
      <p><b>Genital warts are caused by a virus, Human Papillomavirus (HPV). There are over 70 types of HPV that infect humans including 35 that infect the genitals. Most people (about 75%) with HPV have no obvious signs of infection. When present, visible warts usually develop on the genitals one to three months after exposure. Small warts are treated with medicine applied directly to the warts. Left untreated, the warts can spread, or in some people, such as pregnant women or HIV positive persons, they can become so large that surgery is necessary. They can also bleed and become very painful.<br><br>
      The sexual partners of a person infected with genital warts have about a 60% chance of getting them too. Women with genital warts are urged to have a yearly Pap smear because the virus has been strongly linked with cervical cancer. Anal warts are also caused by the same virus and have been linked to anal cancer. Women and men with anal warts should be monitored by their health care provider.<br><br>
      There  is  currently   a vaccine  (Gardasil®) that protects against genital warts. This vaccine protects against 2 types of HPV that cause most genital warts. It also protects against the 2 types of HPV that cause most cervical cancers in females. The vaccine is given in 3 doses. It is available for males and females age 9 through 26. Doctors recommend that the vaccine be given before someone becomes sexually active (before they  can  be  exposed  to  HPV).  The  vaccine  does  not  prevent  or  treat  genital  warts  or cervical  cancer   if someone  is  already  infected.  Talk  with  your  doctor  for  more information.

      <div class="box" style="height:275px;">Latex Male Condoms And Female Condoms :<br><br>
        Made of polyurethane, when used consistently and correctly, are highly effective in preventing transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis.<br><br>

        Herpes, syphilis and genital warts or HPV are STDs that are passed mainly through skin-to-skin contact either with sores or with infected skin that may look normal. Correct and consistent use of latex male condoms and female condoms can reduce the risk of these STDs only when the infected area or site of potential exposure is protected. While the effectiveness of condoms in preventing transmission of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is less than 100%, condom use has been associated with a lower rate of cervical cancer and HPVassociated disease.

      <p><b>Scabies, also known as the seven-year itch, is a contagious skin infestation by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The most common 
        symptoms are severe itchiness and a pimple-like rash. Occasionally, tiny burrows may be seen in the skin. In a first-ever infection a person will usually develop symptoms in between two and six weeks. During a second infection symptoms may begin in as little as 24 hours. These symptoms can be present across most of the body or just certain areas such as the wrists, between fingers, or along the waistline. The head may be affected, but this is typically only in young children. The itch is often worse at night. Scratching may cause skin breakdown and an additional bacterial infection of the skin.<br><br>
        Scabies is caused by infection with the female mite Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis, an ectoparasite. The mites burrow into the skin to live and deposit eggs. The symptoms of scabies are due to an allergic reaction to the mites. Often, only between 10 and 15 mites are involved in an infection. Scabies is most often spread during a relatively long period of direct skin contact with an infected person (at least 10 minutes) such as that which may occur during sex or living together. Spread of disease may occur even if the person has not developed symptoms yet. Crowded living conditions, such as those found in child-care facilities, group homes, and prisons, increase the risk of spread. Areas with a lack of access to water also have higher rates of disease. Crusted scabies is a more severe form of the disease. It typically only occurs in those with a poor immune system and people may have millions of mites, making them much more contagious. In these cases, spread of infection may occur during brief contact or by contaminated objects. The mite is very small and usually not directly visible. Diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms.</b></p>
